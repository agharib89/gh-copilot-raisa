## Static Site (GitHub Pages)

The static site generated by `build.py` maintains identical appearance and functionality:

✅ **All pages preserved**: Home, Resources, Examples, About, Author, Tutorials, 404
✅ **Navigation functional**: All links work with updated paths
✅ **Styling intact**: CSS and JavaScript assets copied successfully
✅ **Responsive design**: Mobile-friendly layout maintained
✅ **Dark mode toggle**: JavaScript functionality preserved

### Key Differences

**Flask Version:**
- Dynamic URL routing: `/`, `/resources`, `/examples`
- Requires Python runtime and Flask server
- Asset paths: `/static/css/style.css`

**Static Version:**
- Static HTML files: `index.html`, `resources.html`, `examples.html`
- No runtime dependencies
- Asset paths: `/static/css/style.css` (custom domain)
- Hosted on GitHub Pages CDN with custom domain

---

## Testing

Both versions were tested to ensure:

1. **Visual consistency**: Pages look identical
2. **Navigation**: All internal links work correctly
3. **External links**: Resource links open properly
4. **Responsive design**: Mobile and desktop layouts functional
5. **JavaScript**: Dark mode toggle and animations work
6. **Accessibility**: Proper semantic HTML maintained

## Deployment

The static site is deployed to GitHub Pages at:
**https://copilot.agharib.com**
